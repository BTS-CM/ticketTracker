# Bitshares ticket tracker

Use this CLI tool to download and analyze the tickets created on the Bitshares blockchain.

Tickets are used to allocate voting power, so the more valuable the tickets held the more influence the user has.

Run the following commands to proceed:
```
npm i
npm run-script start
```

You'll then be prompted to continue.

On first run, you'll need to fetch the data, then on second run you can perform estimates and calculate potential airdrops with several methods.
